DATA STRUCTURES
definition: ways of organizing info with optimal runtime complexity for adding/removing records

1. QUEUE - FIFO
- enqueuing - adding a record; array.unshift()
- dequeuing - removing a record; array.pop()

2. STACKS - FILO
- adding a record - .push
- removing - .pop

3.LINKED LISTS
- chain of 4 nodes with data and next
- order is always maintained
- head - first node
- tail - last node; won’t have a ‘next’ attribute
- node2.next = node1

4. TREES
- each component is a node
- nodes are parents and children
- children can have siblings
- traversing - iterating through a tree
  - breadth-first - start at top and go left to right
  - depth-first - start at top and left side... go through parent's and associated kids, then next parent
    - think org chart
