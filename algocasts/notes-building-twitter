How would you design _________?
- there's no right answer
- focus is usually on data model, but ask if they want you to focus on anything specific
- don't mention specific technologies
- draw!! focus on how you would organize a few features
- talk!!

Generic Process:
ID two core features
  tweeting - what would db look like? how do #topic and @mentions work?
  feed - which tweets to show to a user
possible implementation
ID and address difficulties
solution for scaling (caching or deployment options)
  caching - calc top ten tweets (expensive work), put in memory store so you don't need to recalculate it
  load balancer - has multiple servers
